```Cloud Native | Architecture | Microservices | Kubernetes | Golang```


Today's technology allows us to process and ```analyze large amounts of data for insights``` that lead to strategic decision-making. I firmly believe in using information derived from analyzing big data to influence and drive changes in ```Improving Healthcare and Public Health, Improving Science and Research```, and Improving and optimizing the way cities are managed and organized en route to becoming Smart Cities. 
I consider myself ```multidisciplinary``` and want to have an active role in analyzing, designing, and code development of systems and tools that enhance potential. As I engage, learn and influence the people around me, the traits that allow me to succeed are curiosity, imagination, empathy, active listening, and effective communication. 
Over the last 28 years, I have focused primarily on architecture, engineering, and implementation of distributed enterprise systems in different verticals in Mexico, and the USA. In addition, I have IT industry experience across various verticals: Telecommunications, Banking and Finance, Apparel, Logistics, and, more recently, Health Insurance.
